    Search for a target element using linear search.
    
    Linear search checks every element in the list until it finds the target.
    
    Time Complexity: O(n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    
    Args:
        arr (List[Any]): The list to search in

        int: Index of the target element, or -1 if not found

        >>> linear_search([2, 3, 4, 10, 40], 10)

def binary_search(arr: List[Any], target: Any) -> int:
    """
    Search for a target element using binary search.
    
    Binary search works on sorted arrays by repeatedly dividing the search
    interval in half.
    
    Time Complexity: O(log n)
    Space Complexity: O(1)
    
    Args:
        arr (List[Any]): The SORTED list to search in
        target (Any): The element to search for
        
    Returns:
        int: Index of the target element, or -1 if not found
