    Generate the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
    
    The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, 1, and each subsequent number 
    is the sum of the two preceding ones.
    
    Args:
        n (int): Number of Fibonacci numbers to generate
        
    Returns:
        List[int]: List containing the first n Fibonacci numbers
        
    Examples:
        >>> fibonacci(7)
        [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
        >>> fibonacci(1)
        [0]
        >>> fibonacci(0)

    Hint: Start with [0, 1] and generate subsequent numbers iteratively
