# Student Utility Library

A collaborative Python project designed for students to learn and contribute to open-source development. This library provides various utility functions across different domains including string manipulation, mathematics, data structures, algorithms, and file operations.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to:
- Provide hands-on experience with Python development
- Teach collaborative coding practices
- Introduce students to testing and documentation
- Build a comprehensive utility library through community contributions

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Run tests to verify setup:
   ```bash
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from students! Here's how to get started:

1. **Choose a function to implement**: Look for functions marked as `# TODO: Implement this function`
2. **Read the docstring**: Each function has detailed documentation explaining what it should do
3. **Implement the function**: Follow the specifications in the comments
4. **Write tests**: Add unit tests for your implementation
5. **Test your code**: Ensure all tests pass
6. **Submit your contribution**: Create a pull request

### Guidelines
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Write clear, readable code with comments
- Include comprehensive docstrings
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Keep functions simple and focused
